## Description

Whether it's warm, whether it's cold...

This is WhetherFit. An interactive application that assists the user in picking out appropriate clothing to keep you comfortable for the elements ahead.

We began by incorporating the Dark Sky API to pull weather data for today and tomorrow's weather. We combined this with accessible and responsive design to create a seamless experience for the user to plan ahead. 

## Technologies Used 

APIs used: 

1. [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) 
2. public.opendatasoft.com API:  Convert a zipcode to lat/lon coordinates
3. [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api): Weather Icon

Written with: 

1. HTML 
2. CSS (Bulma framework)
3. JavaScript 

## Features 

Basic: 
* Takes an input of the zipcode for a location & displays the "Feels Like" temperature which takes into account wind chill or heat index. 
* Based on temperature, WhetherFit prints suggested clothing item images. 

Extra: 

* Assesses the precipitation chance and prints an umbrella to the screen if it is above a 35% chance. 

* Sign up modal to indicate future personalized user experience. 

* Sticky Footer crediting the API used. 

* Icon indicating the current weather conditions pulled from a separate API. 

Future Features: 

* Pulling from a clothing API (ASOS Unofficial) to fill icons with recommended clothing based on the user's preferences. 
* Incorporating Pollen Count/ Air Quality in given forecast. 
* User management system -> Users can create an account and indicate preferences for what they want to see. 
* Daily text notifications based on User's preference on the time to receive notification.
